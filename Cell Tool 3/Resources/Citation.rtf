Short Title: CellTool: an open source software combining bio-image analysis and mathematical modeling

DOI: 10.1101/454256

Abstract: Summary: We present CellTool, a stand-alone open source software with a Graphical User Interface for image analysis, optimized for measurement of time-lapse microscopy images. It combines data management, image processing, mathematical modeling and graphical presentation of data in a single package. Multiple image filters, segmentation and particle tracking algorithms, combined with direct visualization of the obtained results make CellTool an ideal application for rapid execution of complex tasks. In addition, the software allows for the fitting of the results to predefined or custom mathematical models. Importantly, CellTool provides a platform for easy implementation of custom image analysis packages written on a variety of programing languages.
